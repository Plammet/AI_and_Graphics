This code is for applying resnet50 architecture with cifar-10 dataset

cifar-10 dataset and checkpoint (resnet50_epoch285.ckpt) is not included due to upload size.
Make sure that you have cifar-10 dataset and resnet50_epoch285.ckpt in right place.

No additional change is required. You can dirctly run the code.
